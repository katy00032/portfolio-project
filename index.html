             What is the phenomenon, the reason for the popularity of cars produced 
           by the Volkswagen concern? The reason lies in the creation of really 
           high-quality, reliable and diverse cars that are available to ordinary people.
           As a result, young people travel by Volkswagen, housewives in many countries of the world
           go to the store for shopping, pensioners use the models of this manufacturer for traveling,
           businessmen - for quick and comfortable movement to their workplaces and to meetings

           and now it is difficult to find a country on the atlas of our planet
           where there is not at least one model of this legendary automaker.

              99 percent of all programmers are men and only 1 percent are women.
           A programmer does not fix computers, he develops software for them.
           Profession "programmer" is one of the ten most demanded professions in the world.
           90% of all programmers are under 45 years old.
           For a long time, Programmer's Day was unofficial and did not have an exact date,
           so people celebrated it at different times Using a computer can be called 
           simultaneous communication between hundreds of thousands of programmers.
           Almost half of the programmers walk around the 
           office in slippers / flip flops / slates, which is why they are called "Guys in sandals".
           There are about 8,500 programming languages â€‹â€‹in the world, 
           but the number of languages â€‹â€‹that are used most often is just over a dozen.
